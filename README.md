## Example of Halo2-PSE
This source code is an example about specifying PLONKish arithmetization in Halo2.

This is to prove the knowledge of $u, v$ satisfying the following relation
$$\mathcal{R} =\\{(y; (u, v)) : y = f(u, v) = u^2 + 3uv + v + 5\\}$$
where $y$ is public and $(u, v)$ is only known to prover.
